symfony-doc-bot
===============
It uses an elastic search backend with the symfony docs re-indexed to allow searching per paragraph and yield more exact results, the solr query however still has room for improvement.


It consists of 2 parts, the scraper, which is a spider written for Scrapy and a plugin for CloudBot.
